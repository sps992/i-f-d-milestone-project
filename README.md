# Surviving Game Of Thrones

After the hurricane of the Game of Thrones series finale, what a better way to wrap it all up than with an interactive dashboard. Illustrating the deaths and surviving characters of the series, in well presented graphs.
 
## UX

This website is designed for any GOT fan looking to keep the series alive by analysing the mortality of their favourite characters. I plan to do this by providing nicely presented graphs sprinkled with fun GOT facts. I think this will be a great way for fans to relive their favourite scenes in their heads and to better understand who died and who survived, whilst learning more about the series along the way.

 ### User Stories
 
 EXAMPLE FORMAT{ As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.}
 
- As someone who has watched the series, I want to know more about who is still alive, so that I can better understand what actually happened and why certain characters are so important to the plot.

-As a big nerd, I want to find out more about who died and how many of each house is still alive, So I can quence my undying thirst for the series until the prequel comes out next year.

-As someone who has watched a season, I want to view content that is entertaining and interesting, So I can decide whether to continue watching the series.


#### Wireframes

Demonstrating best web practice, I have created wireframes to shape the initial skeleton of the website and where the content could be placed. This is done to understand the space limitations and how to make the website userfriendly and offer the best user experience as possible.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
